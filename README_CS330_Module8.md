# CS 330 – Computational Graphics and Visualization

##  Module Eight Journal Reflection

### How I approach designing software
When designing software, I start by understanding the end goal and breaking down the problem into smaller components. For my 3D scene project, I identified objects, textures, lights, and interactions before writing any code. I also considered the user’s visual experience, focusing on how the scene should look and feel.

### New design skills I developed
This project helped me develop skills in spatial planning, scene composition, and using OpenGL to create realistic 3D objects. I learned how different shapes, textures, and lighting can come together to make an immersive virtual environment.

### My design process
I followed an iterative design process: first sketching the concept, then building objects step by step, and finally refining textures, lighting, and camera movement. I regularly tested after each milestone to make sure the visuals matched my design goals.

### How these tactics apply in the future
This structured, iterative approach can be applied to any software project — breaking problems down, testing early, and refining features over time leads to better results and fewer errors.

### How I approach developing programs
I build programs incrementally, starting with a basic foundation and then adding complexity. For the 3D project, I began with simple shapes, then added textures, light sources, and camera controls, testing each addition carefully.

### New development strategies used
I used modular code design, reusable functions, and incremental testing. This made it easier to identify errors early and improve rendering performance.

### Role of iteration
Each milestone improved the scene — I added more textures, adjusted lighting, and improved object placement. Iteration made the development process smoother and more manageable.

### How my approach evolved
At the start, I focused on simply making things work. Over time, I began to pay more attention to structure, clarity, and visual polish, aligning my code with industry best practices.

### How computer science helps me reach my goals
Computer science gives me technical and problem-solving skills that I can apply to real-world challenges, from building applications to visualizing complex data.

### Applying computational graphics to education and career
This project gave me practical experience with OpenGL, textures, lighting, and scene management. These skills can support advanced coursework in graphics, AI visualization, or game development. Professionally, they can be applied to roles in software engineering, visualization, simulation, and UI/UX.
